# HTML/CSS Practice Templates

This repository contains all the practice templates Iâ€™ve created using **HTML** and **CSS**. Each template is built to improve my understanding of front-end design, layout, and responsiveness.

## What's Inside
- Clean and responsive page layouts
- Practice with common UI components (e.g., pricing section, headers, buttons)
- Simple, beginner-friendly code structure

## Purpose
These templates were created as part of my personal learning journey in web development. I'm actively improving my front-end skills and gradually expanding into JavaScript and React.

## How to Use
You can open any `.html` file in your browser to view the template. Feel free to explore the code and customize it for your own learning or projects.
